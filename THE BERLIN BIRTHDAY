Four to five hundred years ago
Has this line drawn
On this black earth
Immediately the Berlin birthday
When the black antennas was
Given to the 'Ecelebrants' like birthday cakes.
But which black sheep knows
Where the rain began
How he's beaten
How to get dried?
Ageless decades ago
Black pot was broken
Forest's peace chased by steels
Flood of blood uprooted the forest
Comodified brethren fleeted away
Survivals of the middle passage
Wore the masks of slavery
But the pianos went on constant search
Inflicted more worry (s).
Lies ruled out the form
Many bathed emancipation at graves
Dirge was the rhymes at home
Elegy was the songs out there
Lies dewed the forest at dawn
Elephants, Lions, Tigers chained
Maybe the tortoise went astray!
Because the monkeys trampled upon
Escaped the forest to the banks
What wrong went later with them?
Now, the lies has dried our streams
Blocked our screams
Dusted our dreams.
Yes, the refined root is the lies
The stem is the root
The branches are the stem
Many leaves whither away.
The saw hews the tree
And an axe makes logs for free
Fire calls on the smoke
Likewise the charcoal makes the dust
And the wind blows the dust astray.
 

Ecelebrants: European powers.
